I researched how to do binary search. |

I think I may have missed an if statement. |

I began to implement it, but haven't finished yet. |
| 9/23 | 10:45 - 10:55pm  |                                                         I completed my trial of implementing binary search recursively as we did in Spelling Bee. However, I am running into a problem where the algorithm always returns null, even if the word does not appear in the dictionary. |
| 9/23 | 10:55 - 11:05pm  | My problem was that my start and end lengths were determined by the length of the text rather than the length of the dictionary which was causing my problem. I was able to get my code using recursive binary search to work for the sentence, but none of the other tests so far. |
