| 9/23 |  12:45 - 1:00pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                I started to think about it in terms of binary search. I researched how to do binary search. |
| 9/23 |   1:00 - 1:25pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                          I implemented binary search as best I could, but it doesn't quite work. I think I may have missed an if statement. |
| 9/23 |   1:25 - 1:45pm   |                                                                                                                                                                      I looked at SpellingBee from last year to find a recursive binary search algorithm. I began to implement it, but haven't finished yet. |
| 9/23 |  10:45 - 10:55pm  |                                                                                 I completed my trial of implementing binary search recursively as we did in Spelling Bee. However, I am running into a problem where the algorithm always returns null, even if the word does not appear in the dictionary. |
| 9/23 |  10:55 - 11:05pm  |                         My problem was that my start and end lengths were determined by the length of the text rather than the length of the dictionary which was causing my problem. I was able to get my code using recursive binary search to work for the sentence, but none of the other tests so far. |
| 9/24 |  11:40 - 11:50pm  |                                                                                                                          I realized that the other test cases aren't working with my current sorting algorithm because it is too slow. I looked into other sorting algorithms online which could be faster. |
| 9/24 | 11:50pm - 12:05am | I searched and couldn't find an algorithm that seemed to be faster. Instead, I tried to clean up the code because I noticed that I sometimes received an error about different array lengths being returned than expected. I checked through the code and also added a checker for if there are duplicates. |
| 9/24 |  12:05 - 12:10am  |                            I was able to figure out the duplicates issue by trying various methods (like indexOf() and contains()). I was able to get it to work for 4/5 tests. The Rome test doesn't work because it times out, which I think is because binary search isn't the most efficient algorithm. |
