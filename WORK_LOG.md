| 9/23 | 12:45 - 1:00pm |                                          I started to think about it in terms of binary search. I researched how to do binary search. |
| 9/23 | 1:00 - 1:25pm  |                    I implemented binary search as best I could, but it doesn't quite work. I think I may have missed an if statement. |
| 9/23 | 1:25 - 1:45pm  | I looked at SpellingBee from last year to find a recursive binary search algorith. I began to implement it, but haven't finished yet. |
